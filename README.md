# ia_twitch_streamer
Scraper of GPT-3.5 that is connected to a Twitch chat and talks with the public and reproduce his audio to a virtual cable
You can connect it to other programs like vtube studio or some reactive png program for streaming
It's possible to use voice changers to his audio output to make it sound more human

# Scraper
Its use a scraper to get to the gpt model, but if you have a licence or you own a chatbot you can modify the program easily replacing some code and the function Silv_CORE 

# Additional Notes
I put the autorisation variable in a text cuz you can play anything throught the output at the same time the principal program is running
//IMPORTAT//
Start the js first or principal program not get any input, another thing, I use the name of my realtek virtual cable but windows sometime change it a bit so maybe you need to verify the name of your virtual cable of your realtek or use another virtual cable
